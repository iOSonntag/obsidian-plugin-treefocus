### Ever wanted to (*dim*) a `File` or `Folder`?  
*For rarely used or unimportant `Files` or `Folders`.*  

**Example:**
<br/>
<br/>
<img src="resources/treefocus_dim_01.png?raw=true" width="100">
- `/_SYS/` (maybe for your template and attachment Folders)
- `/some_dir/not_in_use/` (storing some irrelevant data)

### Or maybe **HIGHLIGHT** some `Files` and `Folders`?

*For the good stuff.*  

**Example:**
<br/>
<br/>
<img src="resources/treefocus_highlight_01.png?raw=true" width="100">
- `/Main/`
- `/VeryImportantFolder_DoNotDelete_Plz/`

### Or any other imaginable config for your file explorer items?

*‚úÖ This plugin might do the trick!*



<br/>
<br/>

# TreeFocus - Intro
**Highlight**, **dim** & **style** your `Files` & `Folders` in the file
explorer based on predefined or custom rules.

All your vault items in the left navigation panel can be styled. Either via 
- **matching rules** *or* 
- **explicitly set** via the item context menu

Every item in the file explorer evaluates to one of the following
**TreeFocusModes**‚Ñ¢ :
- üí° `HIGHLIGHT` 
- ü•± `DIM` 
- üçÜ `DEFAULT` (Obsidian default)

Then each item will be styled based on that **TreeFocusMode**‚Ñ¢.

<br/>

## Combine with other Plugins
You like the **`Icon Folder`** plugin?  
Me too that is why this plugin is fully
compatible with the plugin [Icon Folder (`obsidian-iconize`)](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize).
> Hurray üï∫ üéä üéâ !!!  
> Big shout out @ [FlorianWoelki](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki) for his
> awesome plugin.


<br/>

## How it all works
*Example config result:*

<br/>

The screenshot is the result of choosing the
- **Style Transformation Preset:** `Fancy` 

and applying the following rules:


1. **TreeFocusMode**‚Ñ¢ - `DIM`  
on all `Files` and `Folders` starting with `'_'`

2. **TreeFocusMode**‚Ñ¢ - `HIGHLIGHT`  
on explicit selected items:
    - `/Backend`
    - `/More`


<br/>
<br/>

## Settings

You can configure the behavior of this plugin by either defining general rules
or explicitly set the **TreeFocusMode**‚Ñ¢ per `File` / `Folder`.

<br/>
<br/>

## Explicit Transformations: Configurations On Item Level

Right click on an item in the file explorer gives you options to explicitly
apply **TreeFocusModes**‚Ñ¢. This overwrites all defined rules and can be reset at any time.

## DISCLAIMER

I do not own the **TreeFocusMode**‚Ñ¢ nor the **TreeFocusModes**‚Ñ¢ trade mark. This
is pure parody on the stupidity of that trade mark. Developers do these kind of
jokes :D - Have a great day!
