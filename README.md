Highlight, dim & style your files & folders in the file explorer (navigation)
based on predefined or custom rules.

> Also works in combination with [`obsidian-iconize` / `obsidian-icon-folder` plugin](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize)! Hurray ðŸ•º ðŸŽŠ ðŸŽ‰ !

## Example Result

<br/>

The screenshot is a result of choosing the **Transformation Theme** `Fancy` and is
based on the following set of rules:

<br/>

- activate `DIM` mode on all files / folders starting with `"_"`
- explicitly activate mode `HIGHLIGHT` on:
  - `/Backend`
  - `/More`


<br/>
<br/>

## Settings

You can configure the behavior of this plugin by either defining general rules
or explicitly set the transformation mode per file / folder.

<br/>

## Explicit Transformations: Configurations On Item Level

Right click on an item in the file explorer gives you options to explicitly
apply focus modes. This overwrites all defined rules and can be reset at any time.
