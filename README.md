# Obsidian Plugin: TreeFocus

Highlight, dim & style your files & folders in the file explorer (navigation)
based on predefined or custom rules.

> Also works in combination with `obsidian-iconize` / `obsidian-icon-folder` plugin! Hurray 🕺 🎊 🎉 !

## Example Result

<br/>

The screenshot is a result of choosing the Transformation Theme `Fancy` and is
based on the following set of rules:

<br/>

- activate `DIM` mode on all files / folders starting with `"_"`
- explicitly activate mode `HIGHLIGHT` on:
  - `/Backend`
  - `/More`


<br/>
<br/>

## Settings

You can configure the behavior of this plugin by either defining general rules
or explicitly set the transformation mode per file / folder.
